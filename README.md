# Olympics Data Project

I've created an app on Heroku to understand the analysis summer olympics held till 2016.

This has 4 pages:

***Medal Tally:***

Each country's position with respect to won medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze). You can also check for any particular year or country level medal informations here.

***Overall Analysis:***

You can check some overall level statistics here.

***Country-wise Analysis:***

For a particular country, you can get all the related informations here i.e. medals won, most medals in sports etc.

***Athlete wise Analysis:***

Here you can find athlete level informations like age & sex wise distribution.

This app is particularly created in python 3.7 version environment.

If you've any questions related to Heroku deployment, you can check the Heroku documentation page.
